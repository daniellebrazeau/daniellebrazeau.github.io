 <!-- A blurb about my riding experience --> 
   <h1> My Riding Experience </h1>   
<hr>       
      <p1 class= "round2"> I have been riding predominently english for 17 years. 
      Being only 5 foot 1, I can ride anything from small ponies to large horses. I currently own my own mare, but have leased many horses over the years. 
      I have ample experience riding green broke horses and have the tools to finish them to be solid citizens. I have been coaching students for 8 years and really focus on the fundamentals and using your body correctly while riding.
