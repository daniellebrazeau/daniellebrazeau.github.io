   <h1> My Riding Experience </h1>   
<hr>   
    <div>
      <p> I have been riding predominently english for 17 years. 
      Being only 5 foot 1, I can ride anything from small ponies to large horses. I currently own my own mare, but have leased many horses over the years. 
      I have ample experience riding green broke horses and have the tools to finish them to be solid citizens. I am currently the head coach for beginner to intermediate riders at Miron Valley Stables in Trenton, Ontario and been coaching for 8 years, with my main focus on the fundamentals and using your body correctly while riding. 
      </p>
      <p> I offer many services around the barn, including but not limited to riding client horses, teaching private or group lessons, braiding and mane pulling for shows. I have been riding/ working at my current stable for 14 years and know the horses and students very well. </p>
